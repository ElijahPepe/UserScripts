{{Information page|WP:NPPSG|WP:NPPSOURCEGUIDE|WP:SOURCEGUIDE|WP:NPRSG}}The purpose of this page is to centralize information about [[wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] for use by [[Wikipedia:NPP|new page reviewers]] when reviewing new articles. It is intended as a supplement to the [[Wikipedia:RSN|reliable sources noticeboard]] and [[Wikipedia:RSP|List of Perennial Sources]], to help page reviewers unfamiliar with a given subject assess notability and neutrality of an article––entries should focus on whether a specific publication is sufficiently reliable for significant coverage in the publication to count toward notability for a subject. Disagreements with assessments here should be escalated to the reliable sources noticeboard, with a notice also placed on the talk page of this article to notify editors about the discussion.

This page is organized into sections corresponding to specific topics and regions that share sources in common. Sources may be included in more than one section if they are relevant to more than one section.

{{TOC limit|4}}

== Instructions ==
===How to use and improve this page===
Claims about a source's reliability should be cited to either to the [[WP:RSP|perennial sources list]] or to discussions that demonstrate a  consensus that the claim is true. Note that this is a considerably weaker standard than the [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources#How to improve this list|one employed at the perennial sources list]]. This is because the purpose of this list is to provide at-a-glance reliability judgments for editors working on unfamiliar subjects, not to be a final arbiter on matters of reliability. While the discussions cited in this page may be useful resources when arguing about a given source's reliability, a source's inclusion in any given category on this page should not be used as an argument in any protracted discussion over a source's reliability.

If you would like to expand this page with the contents of a WikiProject source guide, either format a link to the relevant guide as a citation, or include it using a {{tl|main}} or {{tl|see also}} template. Entries should ideally mention when and where the cited discussion was held, and the level of participation. When listing a date, simply mention the month that the discussion was closed in, as this is sufficient context while also being easy to note when listing a new entry.

If you disagree with any assessment listed on this page, either provide citations justifying a change, or start a discussion on the [[WP:RSN|reliable sources noticeboard]] in order to establish a more holistic and up to date consensus. However, be mindful of the level of support for the claim that you intend to challenge: for instance, challenging sources listed at the perennial sources list is much less likely to result in a new consensus than challenging sources supported by a single discussion.

Contextual information about sources' affiliations, biases, and other information beyond a reliability judgment is intended to provide information to help contextualize sources, primarily to assess if an article is likely to be missing additional viewpoints.

[[Newspapers of record]] are generally considered to be reliable for purposes of [[WP:N|notability]] and uncontroversial topics. However, more care may need to be taken when evaluating an article's [[WP:NEUTRAL|neutrality]].

=== Adding entries ===

* All information in this page should be written to reflect existing [[wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] elsewhere on Wikipedia.
* Please include a reference with every entry.
* This list should mostly be secondary sources, but a few important primary sources are acceptable. Just make sure to mention in its entry that it is a primary source.
* Entries should have a consensus of two editors or more somewhere else on Wikipedia (usually [[WP:RSN]], but Wikiprojects and other places are also acceptable).
* If you add an entry that only has one editor that discussed it, put it in the "no consensus" category, and mention that there was not enough discussion to generate a consensus. Also mention what the editor said about the source.

=== Formatting ===

Sub-headings should be titled "Reliable", "Unreliable", or "No consensus". Entries should use the following format.

* ''[[The New York Times]]'' [https://nytimes.com], description here.<ref>Link to [[WP:RSN]] discussion or other location</ref>

Write the common name first, and wikilink it if it has an article. Then include a compact external link to the source's website. These external links are important. Then include a description of the source's reliability, and any concerns or caveats that were mentioned during the original source discussion. Finally, include a reference to the original source or source discussion. For example, [[WP:RSN]], [[WP:RSP]], or a WikiProject resource page.

{{See also|Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources (medicine)}}
Keep in mind that even if a journal is reliable, [[WP:MEDRS]] usually requires using a secondary source. So that means the article needs to be marked as a [[Review article|review]], [[systematic review]], [[meta-analysis]], guideline, or [[practice guideline]]. It is not usually appropriate to cite a paper describing a single study or experiment, which is a primary source.

[[Peer review|Peer reviewed]] is not the same thing as a [[review article]]. Most journal articles are peer reviewed.

[[Preprint|Preprints]] are not peer reviewed, and are not a reliable source.

Journal articles should be from a journal that is related to the subject. Citing a journal article about [[epilepsy]] that was published in ''Environmental Science and Pollution Research'' is probably not appropriate.
